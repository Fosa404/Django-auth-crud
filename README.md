## Django-auth-crud

**Django web application with user authentication**

The app is a personal agenda where each user can *create*, *edit* and *delete* tasks and contacts that are stored in a Postgresql DB.

I´ve created this project for practice purposes since i´m learning Django.

#### Dependencies used for this project:

- django
- psycopg2
- dj-database-url
- psycopg2-binary
- whitenoise[brotli]
- gunicorn

The app is deployed on Render so you can visit the link and see the final outcome.
